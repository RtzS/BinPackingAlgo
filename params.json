{"name":"Binpackingalgo","tagline":"Binpacking Algorithm using html5, javascript & css","body":"### Welcome Here!.\r\n    \r\n  The best fit decreasing and first fit decreasing strategies are among the simplest heuristic algorithms for solving the bin packing problem. They have been shown to use no more than 11/9 OPT + 1 bins (where OPT is the number of bins given by the optimal solution).\r\n\r\n###Logic\r\n  Here bean packing algorithm is implemented using javascript, which is used for solving the problem related adjustment of increasing decreasing square areas.\r\n\r\n### Technology Used\r\n   To develope this project HTML5, CSS3 and javascript is used. HTML% & Css is used to give the stylish view, Javascript is used to develop actual logic of project.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n RTZ\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
